QuickPhrase
===========

QuickPhrase is a browser-based word game, similar to the game Catch Phrase. QuickPhrase includes an additional game mode, where the timer is set to a shorter amount of time (usually 10 seconds), but each word restarts the timer. This variant of the game makes increases the overall difficulty and makes it impossible to cheat by running out the clock.

This version is written in the [Elm programming language](https://elm-lang.org/).
